# TicTacToe and Redux

This is a an application that implements redux to help the CTRI Juniors of CodeSmith.

You have already done tic-tac-toe with react class components,
let's now do it with redux!!

A brief intro to redux:

Redux is a state management framework for react applications. (React is the library)
It's imporanant to note that the benefit of using redux is mostly apparent in much larger applications.
It can be troublesome to set up, but once it is set up, you have an application that is easier to maintain and iterate upon.

There are lots of help resources for redux on line, so for now
feel free to dive into the code and see what's going!

Remember to run

`npm install`

before running the application and

`npm run dev`

to run it in on webpacks dev server!

Enjoy!!
